## About:
This project is inspired by the RoboCup Rescue competition, which promotes research into intelligent rescue robots. Our goal is to design a small, tele-operated rescue robot capable of navigating through complex environments, such as rough terrains, maze walls, and stairs, to locate and extract a survivor.  The survivor is represented by a tennis ball. The robot must be remotely controlled, fit within a 250mm diameter and height cylinder, weigh less than 1000gm, and cost under $120.

## Objectives
* Navigate through a maze under operator control
* Maneuver over rough terrain
* Detect and report objects in its path
* Identify and rescue a victim (tennis ball)

### Conceptual Design
Our design process began with brainstorming and evaluating various concepts. We focused on simplicity, robustness, and cost-effectiveness. The final design includes:

* **Mechanical:** A compact and lightweight chassis designed to fit within the specified dimensions.
* **Electrical:** Efficient power management using the Arduino Uno, motor drivers, and sensors.
* **Computing:** Implementation of control algorithms for navigation and ultrasonic sensor implementation obstacle detection

### Final Proposed Design

### Implementation Steps
* **Conceptual Designs:** Initial ideas covering the basic features of the robot.
* **Design Proposal:** Detailed documentation of the chosen design.
* **Build:** Construct the robot with small modifications based on preliminary testing.
* **Final Testing:** Evaluate the prototype robot's performance in a series of tests.

## Final Build:

## Testing:

The robot has undergo several tests and excelled at each of them:

* **Manoeuvring through a maze:** Evaluating its ability to navigate tight spaces.
* **Mapping Environment:** Using the ultrasonic sensor map the maze into a 2D map.
* **Handling rough terrain:** Testing its capability to climb and descend steps.
* **Rescuing a victim:** Ensuring gentle handling and transportation of the tennis ball.

## Conclusion:
The Robot to the Rescue (R2R) project is a comprehensive effort to design and build a small, intelligent rescue robot. Through careful planning, innovative design, and thorough testing, we aim to create a robust and efficient robot capable of performing rescue operations in complex environments. The project not only demonstrates the application of engineering principles but also fosters teamwork and problem-solving skills.
Our project was not only the highest marked project in its category, it also won the **people's choice award** amongst all the top projects from their respective categories.
